# DeFi Arbitrage Bot Platform

A production-grade, high-performance DeFi arbitrage bot platform that supports intra-chain, cross-chain, triangular, and cross-exchange arbitrage strategies.

![DeFi Arbitrage Bot](docs/images/defi-arbitrage-bot.png)

## Features

- **Multiple Arbitrage Strategies**:
  - Triangular arbitrage (within a single DEX)
  - Cross-exchange arbitrage (across different DEXes)
  - Cross-chain arbitrage (across different blockchain networks)
  - Flash loan arbitrage (using flash loans for capital efficiency)

- **High Performance Architecture**:
  - Asynchronous processing with Rust's Tokio runtime
  - Low-latency RPC connections
  - Efficient mempool monitoring
  - Parallel execution of strategies and simulations

- **Comprehensive Simulation**:
  - Local simulation for quick validation
  - Tenderly simulation for accurate gas estimation
  - Forked blockchain simulation for complex scenarios

- **Advanced Execution**:
  - Standard transaction execution
  - Flashbots bundles to prevent front-running
  - Dynamic gas price optimization
  - Transaction monitoring and retry logic

- **Robust Security**:
  - Circuit breakers to prevent excessive losses
  - Simulation before execution
  - Secure private key management
  - Comprehensive error handling

- **Monitoring and Observability**:
  - Detailed logging
  - Prometheus metrics
  - Alerting via email, Discord, and Telegram
  - Performance dashboards

## Architecture

The platform is built with a modular architecture consisting of the following core components:

- **Collectors**: Gather data from various sources (mempool, on-chain events, price feeds)
- **Strategies**: Analyze data to identify arbitrage opportunities
- **Simulators**: Validate opportunities by simulating execution
- **Executors**: Execute validated opportunities on the blockchain
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinate all components and manage the flow of data

For more details, see the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Node.js (v16+)
- Foundry (for smart contract development)
- Access to RPC nodes for each network you want to monitor

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/defi-arbitrage-bot.git
cd defi-arbitrage-bot
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Install Rust dependencies
cd packages/defi-arbitrage/rust-core
cargo build --release

# Install smart contract dependencies
cd ../contracts
forge install
```

3. Configure the bot:

```bash
cp config.sample.json5 config.json5
```

Edit `config.json5` with your settings.

4. Deploy smart contracts:

```bash
cd packages/defi-arbitrage/contracts
forge build
forge create --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> src/arbitrage/ArbitrageExecutor.sol:ArbitrageExecutor
```

Update your `config.json5` with the deployed contract addresses.

5. Run the bot:

```bash
cd packages/defi-arbitrage/rust-core
cargo run --release -- --config ../../config.json5
```

For more detailed instructions, see the [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md).

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, see the [API Documentation](docs/api.md).

## Configuration

The platform is configured using a JSON5 file (`config.json5`). Key configuration options include:

- RPC URLs for each network
- Wallet private key and address
- Flashbots configuration
- Strategy parameters
- DEX addresses
- Token addresses

For a sample configuration, see [config.sample.json5](config.sample.json5).

## Smart Contracts

The platform includes several smart contracts for executing arbitrage opportunities:

- `ArbitrageExecutor.sol`: Main contract for executing arbitrage transactions
- Flash loan adapters for various protocols (Aave, Balancer, etc.)
- Interface contracts for interacting with DEXes
